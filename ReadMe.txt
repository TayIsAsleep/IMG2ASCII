DISCLAMER : I am not an experienced python programmer. I have learned programming by first learning Scratch, and now im moving on to Python.
Im sorry if the code is hard to understand or hard to read.



HOW TO USE:
Drag and drop an image file onto one of the "mode_..." files.

mode_black_and_white.py : Does what it says on the tin, generates an ascii image only using characters, and no terminal colors.
mode_color.py : Does the same as b&w, but this time it adds the colors to the terminal output. This is mostly for show, as copy-pasting this output will result in just a b&w image
mode_discord.py : This script should generate an image that should be >2000 characters, wich means it can be sent over Discord. This is still just a work in progress!
mode_customizable.py : This script does not offer ALL the settings that can be customized with my code, but it allowes you to change a few extra settings then in the others.


HOW TO CUSTOMIZE CHARACTERS COMPLETELY:
Open the "mode_make_your_own.py" and read the comments. They explain what all the settings currently do.
